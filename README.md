I broke the project into 4 parts (regions)
  - Part 1: Header 
  - Part 2: Sections
  - Part 3: Aside
  - Part 4: Footer

## Part 1
### HTML Issues

Issue 1: div class = "header" is not semantic - WILL BE A header (FIXED - DONE)

Issue 2: div is not semantic WILL BE A nav (FIXED - DONE)

The hash marks allow you to refer to the ids on page

### CSS Issues


The next selectors specify apply to every thing *, and to the body 

Use of marketing class to select (specifiy/control) elements properties (specifications) more efficiently.
This corresponds to the next 6 selectors.  

The next two specifications inform the specifications for the a and p elements 

Specifcations for center photo 



## Part 2
### HTML Issues

Issue 3: div class="info-social" WILL BE section (FIXED - DONE)

Issue 4: div class="info-social" WILL BE section (FIXED - DONE) 

Issue 5: div class="info-social" WILL BE section (FIXED - DONE)

Use of benefit-info class to select (specifiy/control) elements properties (specifications) more efficiently

Swicth order with info-social because it did not match the order in html
